# Budget Manager

Welcome to my repository, Budget Manager. The Budget Manager project helps users track their expenses and manage their budget efficiently. It allows users to add, edit, and delete budget items and view their spending trends over time.


# Introduction

Welcome to my Single Page Application (SPA), a dynamic front-end portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite for optimal performance. Leveraging Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design, this application offers an intuitive way to manage your finances. You can easily track your bank account balance and manage transactions, including expenses, savings, and income. The interactive dashboard provides visual feedback with dynamic bar charts to help you understand your financial data at a glance.

For added security, the application includes a login page. Currently, it utilizes mocked data stored in local storage, with plans to integrate a PostgreSQL database and Node.js backend in the future for enhanced functionality and data management.
